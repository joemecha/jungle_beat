# Jungle Beat

## Description
This project is a very simple drum machine program. The goal of this project is to explore one fundamental data structure in computer science â€“ the _linked list_.

## Development Steps
  * Iteration 0 - Node Basics
  * Iteration 1 - Append, All and Count (Single Node)    __IN PROGRESS__
  * Iteration 2 - Append, All and Count (Multiple Nodes)
  * Iteration 3 - Insert and Prepend
  * Iteration 4 - Find, Pop, and Includes?
  * Iteration 5 - Creating a Linked List Wrapper
  * Iteration 6 - Playing Beats
  * Extensions - Validating Beats, Speed & Voice
  
  
## A linked list should be able to do the following:
  - Insert elements
  - Pop an element from the end
  - Push an element onto the beginning
  - Remove the (first occurance	all occurances) of an element by data content
  - Remove an element by position
  - Add an element at an arbitrary position
  - Add an element after a known node
  - Find whether a data element is or is not in the list
  - Find the distance between two nodes
